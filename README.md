# Pokemon Stats-to-Type Analysis
We want to explore whether the anime and game versions of Pokemon are consistent with each other. Specifically, we seek to explore the following questions using k-NN classification algorithm.

1. Can we classify all Pokemon according to their primary type (`Type 1`) using their basic stats alone?
2. Which primary types of Pokemon can be distinguished easily in terms of their basic stats?
3. Can we classify legendary and non-legendary Pokemon using their basic stats alone?
